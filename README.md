# TheOddBotsOut

This is the current source code of The Odd Bots Out.

This has been uploaded (with certain auth keys stripped) due to Twitter asking for a copy of it with instructions on "how to log into it" so my write restrictions are removed.

You can't exactly 'log in' to this app, as it's just running off a machine in my network in a manner that nobody else can interract with.

'corpus' contains raw JSON files collected from tweets by James Rallison.
'model' is those JSON files, formatted into a way that is readable by the program
'bots.rb' is most of the customisation; this was all I really edited from the original repo.
'Gemfile' does all of the magic.
